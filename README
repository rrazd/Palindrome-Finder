I really like solving programming puzzles because the instant gratification of seeing
the fruits of your labor a.k.a the correct output, is amazing!


Solution to the following Puzzle:
_________________________________

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


NOTE
____

I made the program general so that one can calculate the largest palindrome for 
a user specified number of digits. Upon testing for 5 digits the time for the program
to run became rather unreasonable. 

It was clear to me when devising the algorithm (uses brute force) that it would be O(n^2). 
I agree that this is not optimum however it does seem to be the most robust method for 
finding the solution. 

Furthermore, I expect run-time to decrease if the functions from C++ library were used
(I did not use any built in functions because I wanted to practice writing everything from
scratch).
