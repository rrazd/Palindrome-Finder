Solution to the following Puzzle:
_________________________________

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


NOTE
____

I made the program general so that one can calculate the largest palindrome for 
1,2,3,4 digits. Upon testing for 5 digits the time for the program to run became
unreasonable. It was clear to me when devising the algorithm (uses brute force)
that it would be Little Omega(n)
